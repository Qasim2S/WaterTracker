# Water Tracker

This project was createed using react where you are abel to track your daily and lifetime amount of water

This was my first time using reactjs to create a website and it was a fun experience learning this. I hope to create much more using reactjs sites in the future and taking everything I learned in this project and incorporating into my upcoming projects.
